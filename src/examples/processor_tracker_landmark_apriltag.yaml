detector parameters: 
    quad_decimate:  1.5      # doing quad detection at lower resolution to speed things up (see end of file)
    quad_sigma:     0.8	     # gaussian blur good for noisy images, may be recommended with quad_decimate. Kernel size adapted (see end of this file) 
    nthreads:       8       # how many thread during tag detection (does not change much?)
    debug:          false    # write some debugging images
    refine_edges:   true    # better edge detection if quad_decimate > 1 (quite inexpensive, almost no diff)
    refine_decode:  false    # improve detection probability for small tags (quite expensive (~*3)
    refine_pose:    false    # improves detection by maximizing local contrast so that future pose extraction works better (VERY expensive ~*10-20)
    ippe_min_ratio:     3.0  	# quite arbitrary, always > 1 (to deactive, set at 0 for example)
    ippe_max_rep_error: 2.0     # to deactivate, set at something big (100)

# Annexes:
### Quad decimate: the higher, the lower the resolution
# Does nothing if <= 1.0
# Only values taken into account:
# 1.5, 2, 3, 4
# 1.5 -> ~*2 speed up

# Higher values use a "bad" code according to commentaries in the library, smaller do nothing
### Gaussian blur table:
# max sigma          kernel size
# 0.499              1  (disabled)
# 0.999              3
# 1.499              5
# 1.999              7
