/** \brief Landmark tracker processor
 *
 * This is an abstract class.
 *
 * This class implements the incremental landmark tracker.
 *
 * The incremental tracker contains three pointers to three Captures of type CaptureBase,
 * named \b origin, \b last and \b incoming:
 *   - \b origin: this points to a Capture where all Feature tracks start.
 *   - \b last: the last Capture tracked by the tracker.
 *     A sufficient subset of the Features in \b origin is still alive in \b last.
 *   - \b incoming: the capture being received. The tracker operates on this Capture,
 *     establishing correspondences between the features here and the features in \b origin.
 *     Each successful correspondence
 *     results in an extension of the track of the Feature up to the \b incoming Capture.
 *
 * This processor creates landmarks for new detected Features, and establishes constraints Feature-Landmark.
 *
 * This tracker builds on top of the ProcessorTracker by implementing some of its pure virtual functions.
 * As a reminder, we sketch here the pipeline of the parent ProcessorTracker process() function.
 * We highlight the functions implemented here with a sign  '<--- IMPLEMENTED', and the ones to be implemented by derived classes with '<=== IMPLEMENT'
 *
 *   - On each incoming Capture,
 *     - processKnown() : Track known features in the \b incoming Capture           <--- IMPLEMENTED
 *     - Check if enough Features are still tracked, and vote for a new KeyFrame if this number is too low:
 *     - if voteForKeyFrame()                                                       <=== IMPLEMENT
 *       - processNew() : Populate the tracker with new Features                    <--- IMPLEMENTED
 *       - makeFrame(), setKey() : Make a KeyFrame with the \b last Capture         <--- IMPLEMENTED
 *       - establishConstraints() : Establish constraints of the new Features       <--- IMPLEMENTED
 *       - reset() : Reset the tracker with the \b last Capture as the new \b origin<--- IMPLEMENTED
 *     - else
 *       - advance() : Advance the tracker one Capture ahead                        <--- IMPLEMENTED
 *
 * The most important implemented methods are:
 *   - processKnown() : which calls the pure virtual, to be implemented in derived classes:
 *     - findLandmarks() : find Landmarks from the \b map in \b incoming            <=== IMPLEMENT
 *   - processNew() : which calls the pure virtuals:
 *     - detectNewFeatures() : detects new Features in \b last                      <=== IMPLEMENT
 *     - createLandmark() : creates a Landmark using a new Feature                  <=== IMPLEMENT
 *     - findLandmarks() : find the new Landmarks again in \b incoming              <=== IMPLEMENT
 *   - establishConstraints() : which calls the pure virtual:
 *     - createConstraint() : create a Feature-Landmark constraint of the correct derived type <=== IMPLEMENT
 *
 * Should you need extra functionality for your derived types, you can overload these two methods,
 *
 *   -  preProcess()  { }
 *   -  postProcess() { }
 *
 * which are called at the beginning and at the end of process() respectively.
 * See the doc of these functions for more info.
